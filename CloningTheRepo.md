##  **Here are instructions on how to clone the repo**

### **On mac/linux**

1.  Open Terminal.

2.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

3.  Type in the following

4.  ``` $ git clone https://github.com/Coding-Club-FedUni/CodingClub.git```

5.  Press Enter


## **On windows**

1.  Open Git Bash.

2.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

3.  Type in the following

4.  ```$ git clone https://github.com/Coding-Club-FedUni/CodingClub.git```

5.  Press Enter


If/When you make changes locally please checkout a branch with your name, for example

```$ git checkout -b DavidMartin ```

when you have made changes in the folder sync those changes to the remote using 

```$ git push```

Then head to the repository on git hub and submit a pull request(PR) and assign a reviewer(this will give someone a chance to look over your code to ensure there are no mistakes)

Once a review is succesful the PR can be merged to the main branch and the branch you were working on can be safely deleted.

To make sure your local repo(copy on your machine) is synced up to the one on github use

```$ git pull```

NB the above assumes you have git installed on your machines.
