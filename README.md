### How to use the repo!

 -clone the repo to your local machine using git clone 

 -once you have done this you will have a copy of the repo on your local machine where you can add resources.

 -to sync those changes to the remote repo so everyone has access you will need to add, commit and then push.
 
 -occasionally pull from the repo to get any updated resources.



### For ease of use I have included a [CloningTheRepo.md](CloningTheRepo.md) which has the commands for mac/linux/windows.
